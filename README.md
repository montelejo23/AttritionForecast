# Attrition Prediction with Machine Learning
This repository contains a Python notebook designed to predict employee attrition using machine learning techniques. The notebook walks through the end-to-end process of data preparation, exploration, modeling, and evaluation to find insights from employee data.

## Features
Data preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends and relationships in the data.
Machine Learning Models: Implementing and comparing predictive models.
Evaluation Metrics: Assessing the performance of the models to select the best one.

## Data
The notebook uses a dataset named attrition.csv. Ensure the file is placed in the same directory as the notebook or update the file path accordingly. The dataset contains relevant information to employee attrition, such as demographic information, job satisfaction, and performance metrics.

## Workflow
1. Data Cleaning: Clean data, managing column names and missing values. 
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualize key variables and their relationship with Attrition. 
3. Feature Engineering: Manage categorical variables and scale features as needed. 
4. Model Training: Split data into training and test datasets and train the machine learning models. 
5. Model Evaluation: Use metrics to evaluate model perfmance.

## Outputs
Visualizations that uncover trends in the dataset.
Predictive model performance metrics.
Insights into the key drivers of employee attrition.
